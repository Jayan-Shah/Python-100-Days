// Used for Coding statement
# Used for explaination

# Coding tools used in python for Day 1 and errors faced and how they were resolved
// print("")
# print is the function used to display on the output screen
# Double parenthesis shows that it is a function
# Double Quotes are used to seperate coding statements from normal text which we want to print

# Error Debugging: Just google the error and check previous such errors made by other programmers
# Websites like Stack Overflow you an edge

// print("print("What to print")")
# It will throw error as double quotes inside double quotes is syntax error
# To print above statement you need to write statement as
// print('print("What to print")')
#Use '' and "" both to print a fucntion as output within function

# Check indentation whenever you write code in python
# print("Hello" + "Jayan")
Output: HelloJayan
Concatenation of Strings is assigned to operator '+' but no space is comes to between words by default

# Input function
// input(prompt)
// input("What is your name")
# Take care when you type the prompt message to show on output cursor does not go to next line by default 
like print function
# So use "\n" for cursor to go on next line
# Input function takes value and store in string format

For Debugging step by step and see working of the code we can use
"Thonny Site"
#######

// len(String "" or variable having string)
# It returns the value of number of charactes present in the string 
# TAKE CARE when you use len function space is also calculated as character

# Variable Name
- Choose variable name as such that it makes sense and is understandable
- No space allowed between words or else it throw syntax Error
- No keywords allowed as variable name
- Dont use numbers in your variable name
