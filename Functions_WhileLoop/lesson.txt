def is a keyword used to create a function...

def my_function():
my_function is a code block which has a particular task and performs some operations when called

For example
print() and len() functions we have been using are built in functions...

So functions has main two things:
- Declaring Functions 
- Calling Functions
Unless we call function nothing will be performed by the functions...

Even when multiple instructions are there and we do not want to write it again and again we use functions...
Save such information in a function and call it whenever needed....

Spaces vs Tab
Spaces are used in python to indent the code...
Tab sometimes show different indentation on different code editors and different computers...
Even we cant mix spaces and tabs together


While Loops:
while something_is_true:
    # Do something repeteadly
Take care it does not enter into infinte loop
