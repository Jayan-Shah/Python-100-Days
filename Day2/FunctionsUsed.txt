# Data Types

# String
// print("Hello"[0])
# Index always start with 0. It will give output as H
# This is known as subscripting

# Integer
# To write integer just assign numbers without "" and decimal point
# For Large Integers just like you put commas you can put underscore for better understanding

# Float
# Decimal Values 
// print(100/3)
# It will give output as 33.(15 Decimal Points)

#Boolean
Value can be True or False

# Type(Variable or data )
It will give output of data type to user

# Type Error
"123" + 123
# It wont concatenate as one string and one is integer
# Compiler will throw Type Error
// len(123)
# Type Error as function len() expects string value and not integer value

# Type Converion
// input()
# This function takes input in String format
# To convert it into int or float we can type int(input())

# If you take input as string by default and convert it into float
// variable = input("")
// variable = float(variable)
// variable = str(variable)
You cannot convert it into str it will remain in float itself

# Priority
PEMDAS
()
** 
# (The one at left will be at priority) 
* /
+ -

// print(3*3+3/3-3)
1 3*3
2 3/3
3 9+1
4 10-3
# Output : 7  

// round(8/3,2)
# Used to round off the decimal value and 
# 2 after , is used to say till which decimal place answer will be

// print(8//3)
# Floor Division Simply gives you an integer answer

# f-String
f"Your Score is {Any data type variable}"
