// Concept of randomisation
- Mersenne Twister :- Python uses this in order to create pseudo random number generators...

- Random Number is something you see all around in nature and you can observe it when you closely look at noise..
- Pseudo Random Number though depends on seed we provide and it square itself and the middle numbers are again used as seed and repeat itself...
- As it depends on seed it is essential that the seed is long enough that the sequence dont repeat in itself...
  Thus it can be practically random not perfectly...

// Random Module is used in python where they have taken care of all of thus...

-random.randint(a,b) : It will give random whole numbers between a and b incluing them ...

// Module is a small piece of code written which performs a specific function..
- So python developers has created global modules which all can create like random module...
- Even I can create my module in order to use them in my own projects..

// 0.0000000 - 0.99999999 ....
- random.random() :- It gives random floating number between 0 to 1 excluding 1...
- If I want from 0 to 5 just multiply by 5
--> random_float * 5 --> 0.00000... - 4.999999....

- We need seed in order to create random number and the seed can be anything timings or just mouse movements...
- So for same seed number same random number will be shown as ouput.. Thus selection of seed and randomisation of seed itself is important...

// Lists
- Data Structure in python for storing data that has relation to each other and want to group them...

// fruits = [item1,item2]
- In List any kind of data type can exist but what is there is important...
- In list the first element index is 0 because take care of it as offset how much shift is needed in order to move to the first element...

fruits.append("item3) 
So now item3 will be added to the end of the list...

fruits.extend(["item4","item5"])
The entire list will be added ahead..

fruit = str.split(",") 
It will split a string from comma and each will be stored into list of the words...

 // IndexError : List index out of Range
 - This error comes when we go out of index like in list we have 40 elements and I am trying to work with more than 40 elements...
