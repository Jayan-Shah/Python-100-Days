- In list we can find maximum and minimum using function max() and min()

// For Loop in lists
for fruit in fruits:
Here fruit will store every item member of list fruits one by one...
Whenever you write in for loop then take care of indentation...

// For Loop Range
for number in range(a,b):
- It include a and exclude b so if I write (1,10) it will have all numbers except 10...
for number in range(a,b,c)
- c is step by that is it will jump c numbers and go ahead...
For example(1,10,3)
O/p: 1,3,6,9

// In string you cannot update letter as per you do in list even though you can access it as list...
Example
//
name = 'Jayan'
name[0] = 'K'
print(name)
- O/P : TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
//


// In for loop you cannot change the counter inside the loop.. It works according to sequence so use while loop...
// Shuffle fuinction is used only in lists
